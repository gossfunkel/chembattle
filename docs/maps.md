## Explanation 
Different stages offer different resources, conditions, opportunities and challenges. 

Life springs forth from the bountiful primordial soup, and new players earn core gene cards and get an introduction to the game with the training wheels on. Everything you need to thrive is here; this is a map to practice if you're struggling to get your build going, or you're trying to get an idea of how successfully developed boards look. 

In the Normal and Hard difficulties, players face off in various habitable environments, each with its own chemical larder and situational effects. Random events are also triggered in Hard and Hardcore games, prompting players to think on their feet to take better advantage of the change in game state than their opponent does. 

Finally, the Hardcore stages offer only the most dedicated and prepared players the chance to try to survive longer than their opponent in deeply inhospitable and unweildy natural environments. No fun allowed; only grind here.
